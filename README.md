# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I wanted to make a webpage that contained some notes and links for beginner coding students to reference.
It will allow the user to check notes and even link to more in depth doc pages on specific topics if needed.
Creating this page helped me to better remeber the basic concepts of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Usage

This study guide contains notes on four specific topics: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

The user can click on links for each topic and be taken to more in-depth document pages.

The user can open the dev-tools console and see a list of the topics covered as well as see the JavaScript in action when it chooses a random topic for them to study.
